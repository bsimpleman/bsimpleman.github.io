        <p>The first code piece I would like to look at is my work on leaderboardController.js as shown below. I am claiming the entirety of this file.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are many portions of this code that reflect lessons we have learned in class. Looking at lines 26-32 we can see how this code respects
        the privacy lessons we learned in class. Throughout the semester the priority of user security was consistently emphasized. On these lines
        of code I made sure to check if the user had a public or private profile before allowing any of there information to be added to the userList object.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another aspect of this code I am proud of is how flexible it is. We have learned about the importance of creating maintainable and scalable code.
        You can see from lines 3-17 that this code is able to handle different kinds of requests. You can query this with no information, which results in
        all user data being sorted in sent back. You also choose to include a "top="x" query, which takes that value and only returns the top "x" amount of users.
        By coding this in this way it helps make the code much more scalable. Maybe right now querying for every user is reasonable. If there was a million users though
        it would be much less practical. The option to query for only a certain amount is very important for making sure the website can handle any amount of users and
        can adapt to new situations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, I think I did a good job of abstracting out code and keeping certain code private to the class here. You can see on lines 54-56 that the only thing I'm actually exporting here is the readLeaderboard
            function. There's 4 functions in this file, but only readLeaderboard needs to be available to other files. This helps to improve the security of the program,
            and it helps make the program less prone to errors.

            The next piece of code I am claiming is signUpValidation.js. I am claiming the entirety of this file.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Lines 56-70 all handle secure lessons we have learned in class. We have learned the importance of creating secure user information.
            Encrypting information is a good start, but encryption only helps if the password is not so easy that it could be guessed with brute-force.
            These lines of code help to keep users safe by forcing them into using safe password conventions. Regex is used to ensure passwords contains
            a number. Passwords are checked to make sure they are a certain length, and also checked to make sure they have a capital letter. These restrictions
            help to make sure the passwords on our website meet reasonable safety standards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Along on lines of security, on lines 94-102 you can see where I implement session authentication. Signing up causes a token to be generated for the user.
            These lines of codes do not handle the creation of the token, the signup endpoint handles that with JWT. Instead, this portion of code is taking advantage
            of the token created by that endpoint and storing it for future use. This token can be used as a header in other endpoints to ensure the user trying to
            access certain pieces of information is actually intended to be able to access them. Endpoint security is crucial for privacy and safety, so this portion
            of code is essential to helping to keep the website and its user's data safe. We have spent a great portion of time talking about security in class, and
            the usage of JWT with session authentication is a great example of how this code meets the standards we have discussed.

            The next code piece I am using is settingsPage.jsx. I am claiming the entirety of this file.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This was the only page I made on the frontend, since I was primarily on the backend. I learned a lot of making this, and despite it being my first
            attempt at making a page in React, I think a lot here went right, so I wanted to include it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            First, this page takes into account security. The session authentication tokens I mentioned before are utilized here. On lines 32-40 I am setting
            up the page with the user's information. I am accessing data specific to the user logged in though, so it is important that this is done with security
            in mind. For that reason, the "Authorization" header is used, and the JWT token is included. This ensures that none of the user's information
            can be accessed unless the token is correct and the user is who they claim to be.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Similarly, the sign-out button also respects security. The sign-out button calls the function on lines 81-89. This function once again utilizes
            session authentication to make sure the user is who they claim to be, and are not trying to access data they should not be able to interact with.
            This portion of the code is especially important to security though because it calls an endpoint to delete JWT tokens from the account. If a user
            uses a shared-device, the ability to remove tokens from their computer is extremely important. Without this option, anyone who uses their device
            could access their sensitive information.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Next, the page itself follows good UI design and accessibility. All elements are well-separated, contrast well, and have placeholder text that a screen reader could use
            to tell the user what information is expected of them. The page has a score of 94 from Google's Lighthouse metrics. This shows that it was successful in
            being clear and easy to use. We discussed in class how a huge portion of the population suffers from disabilities, so accessibility is a necessity
            for any website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Along the lines of accessibility, this page is extremely clear. Descriptions like on lines 140 and 146 tell the other exactly what will happen if they
            perform certain actions. If you approve email notifications, it says you will be sent an email one week after your last message, for example. Descriptions
            such as these take away any ambiguity and makes our website easy to use and ensures it reacts in a predictable way. We discussed how websites should
            always be predictable, and that idea was put into every element on this page. Clicking a checkbox on means that the boolean value associated with it will
            be set to true. It would be extremely confusing to a user if a checkbox that is on means that the value is false. Small details such as these help to keep
            the page easy to use and helps users avoid frustration from a poor UI.

            The final code piece I am including is userController.js. I am claiming the entirety of this file.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There is a lot going on in this file. It is the controller for the majority of interactions relating to users, such as signing up,
            logging in, logging out, creating a new users, updating a user, etc. This controller is the most significant portion of the backend.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of the most important sections of this code is lines 7-13. This is where the JWT token is created I have referenced in earlier code pieces is created. If this was a real project for production,
            I would use environment variables here, but for the sake of the scope of this project everything in this function is exposed. In this function I use
            a unique identifier for the user, a salt, and an expiry date to create a unique token for session authentication. This token is then appended onto the
            user 's database collection for future use. This function is the foundation for the security of the website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Lines 23-43 handle user login. The aspect of this code I want to highlight is that it takes the email/password and uses a hashing algorithm
            to make sure the data matches the encrypted data in the database. I used the bcrypt library to handle this.
            This was an important decision because I had to look into how to most securely encrypt password.
            Common methods like using MD5 are actually very vulnerable. Bcrypt is based on the "blowfish block
            cipher cryptomatic algorithm" though, which has been shown be very secure. Despite this security, there
            are still some risks. We discussed in class how libraries can be vulnerable. For this reason, it is very important to
            always keep bcrypt up to date to handle any new vulnerabilities that can exist. Also, bcrypt uses a salted hash,
            so it is important that my salt was not easily guessed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The final piece of code here I would like to highlight is lines 74-96. This code checks to see if an email or username is already in use.
            This piece of functionality was very important when we were implementing the sign-up system. It is important that users cannot have conflicting
            information. If it was possible for multiple users to use the same email, a "forgot password" button in the future could go to all of the users'
            inboxes and create a security threat. For this reason, having code implemented that is capable of ensuring that a username and email and unique
            was a very important addition.
